    "The objective of this lab is to produce a mapper which generates data for a reducer which calculates a 2 week total rolling number of cases and deaths per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall idea is that a record for a given week n also needs to be used for the week n+1 as the reducer will need those 2 weeks. So we need to output a record for the year_week and the year_week+1\n",

    "2. Replace the input file with fullweeklycoviddatajson.txt\n",

    "3. Replace the output file with lab6mapperout.txt\n",

    "- Extract the week = int(data[\"year_week\"][5:7])\n",
    "- calculate key1=countryname + week\n",
    "- calculate key2=countryname+(week+1)\n",
    "- set the value1 to a JSON object to contain deaths and cases and week\n",
    "- set the value2 to a JSON object to contain deaths and cases and (week+1)\n",
